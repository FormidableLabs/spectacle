Spectacle is a React-based library for creating sleek presentations using React or Markdown that gives you the ability to live demo your code and use React libraries in your slides.

## How to get started with Spectacle


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="spectacle-cli" label="Create Spectacle CLI" default>
  The fastest and easiest way to get started with Spectacle is to use the Create Spectacle CLI. This will create a new Spectacle project with a default deck and all the necessary dependencies.

  There are four different kinds of templates you can use to create your Spectacle project:

  1. ‚ö°Ô∏è **One Page** - A single HTML file using [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm) that self contains everything you need. Since it does not require a server to run your presentation, this is the recommended option for quickly spinning up a deck.
  2. üìÑ **Markdown** - An app that uses Markdown for your presentation‚Äôs content with support for [Markdown Slide Layouts](md-slide-layouts). This is a React app that uses webpack and imports the Markdown content using Spectacle‚Äôs [`MarkdownSlideSet`](api-reference#markdown-components) component.
  3. üèóÔ∏è **React using Vite** - An app that lets you build your presentation in React and uses Vite for building and running. This is the recommended option if you plan on using a number of additional npm libraries in your presentation.
  4. üèóÔ∏è **React using webpack** - An app that lets you build your presentation in React and uses webpack for building and running.

  **To get started use `npx` or `pnpm dlx` to run the `create-spectacle` cli:**

  ```bash

  $ npx create-spectacle

  ```

  This will create a new Spectacle presentation in a directory of your deck‚Äôs name or one page file in the current directory.


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="autoPlay" label="Manual Installation" default>

  1. Install Spectacle by running `npm add spectacle`.

  2. In your main entry file, return the following Spectacle starter:

    ```tsx
    import { Deck, Slide, Heading, DefaultTemplate } from 'spectacle';

    function App() {
      return (
        <Deck template={<DefaultTemplate />}>
          <Slide>
            <Heading>Welcome to Spectacle</Heading>
          </Slide>
        </Deck>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

    If you are using NextJS with App Router, Spectacle needs to be rendered inside a client component. You can read more about this [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).

## Presenter Mode

Spectacle also has a presenter mode that allows you to view your slides and notes on one screen while your audience views your slides on another. To use presenter mode, open a second browser window and visit your deck‚Äôs local server and enable it by using the key command. You can find more information about presentation controls [here](presenting-controls).
