# Getting Started

The best way to get started is by using the [Spectacle Boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate).

Alternatively, you can `npm install spectacle` and write your own build configurations.

But really, it is SO much easier to just use the boilerplate. Trust me.

## Development

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `npm install`

Next run `rm -R .git` to remove the existing version control.

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`

## Presenting

Spectacle comes with a built in presenter mode. It shows you a slide lookahead, current time and your current slide:

To present:

- Run `npm start`
- Open two browser windows on two different screens
- On your screen visit [http://localhost:3000/?presenter](http://localhost:3000/?presenter)
- On the presentation screen visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
- Give an amazingly stylish presentation

_Note: Any windows/tabs in the same browser that are running Spectacle will sync to one another, even if you don't want to use presentation mode_

You can toggle the presenter or overview mode by pressing respectively `alt+p` and `alt+o`.
