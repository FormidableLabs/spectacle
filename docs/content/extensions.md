# Third Party Extensions

In the past, developers across the open-source-iverse have created extensions for use within your Spectacle presentation.

Since the [release of v6](TODO), the previously developed extensions are no longer compatible with the latest and greatest in Spectacle. We hope that changes soon, and we are happy to support you...

- ... in updating your project if you're one of the folks with a now-deprecated tool.
- ... with PR review and feedback if you're interested in writing a new tool and don't know where to start.

To see a list of the extensions we've listed here in the past, please check out [the archive in git](TODO).
