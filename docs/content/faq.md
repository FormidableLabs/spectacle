# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I export my slides for use elsewhere?

Yes - you can export your slides in PDF format. Appending your presentation URL with `?exportMode=true` will allow you to export your presentation by flattening out your presentation so that you can Print to PDF directly from your browser. ðŸŽ‰

If you want a black & white version of your slides printed to PDF, append your URL with `?exportMode=true&printMode=true` to get a printer-friendly, flattened, black & white print out of your slideshow.

For more info about the query parameters Spectacle supports, please check out our section about it in the [advanced concepts documentation](./advanced-concepts#query-parameters).

## Can I write my presentation in TypeScript?

Yes - Spectacle types are shipped with the package, so you can safely use Spectacle in any `.ts` or `.js` presentation without a separate type definition import. Check out [the exported types](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/main/index.d.ts) for a complete list.
