## Presenting

Spectacle comes with a built-in Presenter view. It shows you a slide lookahead, your current slide and related notes, and the current time.

You also have the option of a stopwatch to count the elapsed time.

To present,

1. Run `yarn start`
2. Navigate to [localhost:3000/#](https://localhost:3000/#) to view your presentation
3. Open a second browser window and navigate to [localhost:3000/#/0?presenter](http://localhost:3000/#/0?presenter) to view your presentation with notes and a clock. Add [?presenter&timer](http://localhost:3000/#/0?presenter&timer) to switch from a clock a timer.
