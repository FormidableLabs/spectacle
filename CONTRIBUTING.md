Spectacle is actively maintained by @[carlos-kelly][] and @[kale-stew][]
from within [@FormidableLabs][formidable-github].

## Development

### Installing dependencies

We prefer to use [`pnpm`][pnpm-docs].

Install all dependencies by running:

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

### Examples

#### Overview

Our examples are spread out across multiple projects depending on where the core technology lies. We publish most of these to `npm` for use in `spectacle-cli` project to either use with the CLI (`spectacle`) or generate a fresh project boilerplate (`spectacle-boilerplate`).

- `spectacle`
  - [`examples/js`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/tree/main/examples/js)
  - [`examples/md`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/tree/main/examples/md)
  - [`examples/one-page`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/tree/main/examples/one-page.html)
- `spectacle-mdx-loader`
  - [`examples/mdx`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-mdx-loader/tree/main/examples/mdx)
- `spectacle-cli`
  - [`examples/cli-mdx-babel`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-mdx-loader/tree/main/examples/cli-mdx-babel): _Not published_

#### This repository

We have various deck scenarios in `examples` in this repository that are part of the development process.

We follow the convention of `start:NAME` to run an in-memory dev server for a specific
example, but we also have a `pnpm run build:examples` script task to make sure we're actually
producing non-broken sample presentations as a CI / assurance test.

#### `examples/js`

A basic deck with JSX and JavaScript:

```bash
# start the dev server
$ pnpm run start:js

# open the browser
$ open http://localhost:3000/
```

**Note**: The files `index.{js,html}`, `slides.md` are published and used by `spectacle-cli`.

#### `examples/md`

A basic deck written in markdown:

```bash
# In one terminal open dev server
$ pnpm start:md

# In another open a browser to 3100
$ open http://localhost:3100/
```

**Note**: The files `index.{js,html}`, `slides.md` are published and used by `spectacle-cli`.

#### `examples/one-page`

A self-contained single web page that uses Spectacle, React, and `htm` for a "no build" presentation!

```bash
# [optional] build the library -
#   comment out the unpkg dependency in
#   index.html and use the local dist/
$ pnpm run build

# open the browser
$ open examples/one-page/index.html
```

_or_ use the single line:

```bash
$ pnpm run start:one-page
```

**Note**: This file is published and used by `spectacle-cli`.

**Development Note**: This JS code portion of this file is programmatically updated from the source in `examples/js/index.js` directly into `one-page.html`. Rather than editing directly, please run `pnpm run build:one-page` and verify changes look good.

### Examples integration with `spectacle-cli`

`spectacle-cli` uses our `js,md,one-page` examples in the CLI and boilerplate tools. To check that changes to these files don't break `spectacle-cli` upstream, check with something like the following:

```bash
# In `spectacle` repo
$ yarn link

# In `spectacle-cli` repo
$ yarn link spectacle

# Check all MDX, MD examples per https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#examples
$ yarn start:examples

# (In another shell) Check mdx:5000, mdx+babel:5001, md:5100
$ open http://localhost:5000/ http://localhost:5001/ http://localhost:5100/

# Check all JS, MDX, MD boilerplates per https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#boilerplate
$ yarn clean:boilerplate
$ yarn boilerplate:generate
$ yarn boilerplate:install
$ yarn start:boilerplate

# (In another shell) Check mdx:6300, md:6100, js:6200
#
# **Note**: These `yarn install` internally so will use latest published
# `spectacle`, so results may be not entirely accurage. You may need to manually
# update the installed contents in generated project `node_modules`.
$ open http://localhost:6300/ http://localhost:6100/ http://localhost:6200/
```

### Testing

To run all tests:

```bash
$ pnpm run test
```

### Linting and Formatting

To check (and fix) code:

```bash
$ pnpm run lint
$ pnpm run lint:fix
```

To check (and fix) formatting of MD, JSON, _and_ code:

```bash
$ pnpm run prettier:check
$ pnpm run prettier:fix
```

We also have a simple one-liner for running both of these fix-checks back-to-back:

```bash
$ pnpm run format
```

Note that there is duplication for JS code in `prettier` doing the same style changes,
but both should be harmonious and run together.

### Before submitting a PR

Thanks for taking the time to help us make Spectacle even better! Before you go
ahead and submit a PR, make sure that you have done the following:

- Run all checks using `pnpm run check-ci`.
- Run `pnpm run build:one-page` and check + commit changes to `examples/one-page/index.html`
- Check that both the core library and _all_ examples build: `pnpm run build`.
- Add a [changeset](#changeset) if your PR requires a version change for any of the packages in this repo.
- Everything else included in our [pull request checklist](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

### Changesets

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to create package versions and publish them.

If your work contributes changes that require a change in version to any of the packages, add a changeset by running:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

which will open an interactive CLI menu. Use this menu to select which packages need versioning, which semantic version changes are needed, and add appropriate messages accordingly.

After this, you'll see a new uncommitted file in `.changesets` that looks something like:

```
$ git status
# ....
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.changeset/flimsy-pandas-marry.md
```

Review this file, make any necessary adjustments, and commit the file to source. During the next package release, the changes (and changeset notes) will be automatically incorporated based on these changeset files.

### Releasing a new version to NPM

<details>
<summary>
<i>Only for project administrators</i>
</summary>

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to create package versions and publish them.

Our official release path is to use automation (via GitHub actions) to perform the actual publishing of our packages. The steps are:

1. Developers add changesets, ideally as part of their PR that have version impacts.
2. On merge of a PR with a changeset file, our automation opens a "Version Packages" PR.
3. On merging the "Version Packages" PR, the automation system publishes the packages.

This streamlines releasing to: ensuring PRs have changeset files added as necessary, and approving the "Version Packages" PR generated from GitHub actions to publish a release to all affected packages.

#### Manual Releases

For exceptional circumstances, here is a quick guide to manually publish from a local machine using changesets.

1. Add a changeset with `pnpm changeset`. Generate the changeset file, review it, and commit it.
2. Make a version. Due to our changelog formatting package you will need to create a personal token and pass it to the environment.
   ```shell
   GITHUB_TOKEN=<INSERT TOKEN> pnpm run version
   ```
   Review git changes, tweak, and commit.
3. Publish.

   First, build necessary files:

   ```sh
   pnpm run build
   ```

   Then publish:

   ```sh
   # Test things out first
   $ pnpm -r publish --dry-run

   # The real publish
   $ pnpm changeset publish --otp=<insert otp code>
   ```

   Note that publishing multiple pacakges via `changeset` to npm with an OTP code can often fail with `429 Too Many Requests` rate limiting error. Take a 5+ minute coffee break, then come back and try again.

   Then issue the following to also push git tags:

   ```sh
   $ git push && git push --tags
   ```

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at coc@formidable.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
