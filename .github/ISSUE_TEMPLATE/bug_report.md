### Describe the Problem

It's easier to show us than tell us what's going wrong with your code. Because of this, we ask that you do one of three things to help us reproduce the bug:

1. Create a public minimal repository that we can `git clone`, with install + error reproduction steps in the README.
2. Fork our [simple Spectacle sample Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/7wo8xv8nw0), reproduce your issue in the code, and paste the link here.
3. Open up a PR, include "WIP" and the Issue # in the title, and point us to the failing regression tests.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

### Additional Information

Any additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.
