### Describe the Problem

<!--

It's easier to show us than tell us what's going wrong with your code. Because of this, we ask that you do one of three things to help us reproduce the bug:

1.  Fork one of the codesandbox examples below, reproduce your issue in the code, and paste the link in this section.
    Simple Spectacle Example:
    https://codesandbox.io/s/lq1tbm
    TypeScript version:
    https://codesandbox.io/s/kqotzi
2.  Create a public minimal repository that we can `git clone`, with install + error reproduction steps in the README.
3.  Open up a PR, include "WIP" and the Issue # in the title, and point us to the failing regression tests.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
